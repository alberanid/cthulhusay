# Cthulhusay

Cthulhusay is the one and only Python cthulhu-fhtagn-ator (not true, but who cares): an extremely sophisticated software to generate curses and/or cake recipes in R'lyehian (also known as Cthuvian).

Forget about cowsay: it's time to talk like a Great Old.  Also, don't forget to walk like a R'lyehian.

## Eeerrr... Ok, I guess, but why?

But for the glory of Cthulhu, of course!

## Is there... I don't know, any documentation maybe?

Seriously?

## I see. What now?

Kn'a nilgh'ri mg r'luhog ep nww mg f'nww uaaahhor bugg.

Which can be translated more or less like "let's add some bugs together to this code": add some feature and do a pull request.

## I'm not sure that Python is truly a R'lyehian language...

You may be right. Here it is the JavaScript version: https://github.com/alberanid/cthulhusay.js
